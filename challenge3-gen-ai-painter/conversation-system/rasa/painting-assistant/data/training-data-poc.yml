    - The stern look lends fear to an already authoritarian bishop's miter. Brownish-red spatters throughout compound the feeling of fear. While I can't see what is written on the tablet, the expression is that of one passing judgement--perhaps at an Inquisition.  The photograph is very well-done, with the background complimenting the sculptured medium.  I can't tell if this is red ceramic or wood, but it looks like it belongs in that setting.  The exquisite detail of the folds of the robe are brought out by the direction of the light.  The strands of the beard and the pattern of the shoe are exquisite.  The statue is missing a left hand, but it is so easy to become lost in the folds of the fabrics that I can overlook this.  Very scary, but very well sculpted and staged.

    - The shawl looks like satin, shiny and white
    - I can't determine if these men are playing (one has his tongue stuck out) or punishing each other.
    - The figures are well-defined, but expressionless.  The landscape is a conglomerate of seasons:  Dry fields (summer) in the background, green deciduous trees in the middle ground (spring), and a tree with turning leaves in the left foreground (autumn).  The stream looks cold.  Nice use of highlights and shadows on the cow and elsewhere, but that cow looks way too skinny to make the trip safely.  The cow is also not tethered. The horse looks well-fed and the humans look plump.  I am unsure why the horseman is riding side-saddle, as it would be un-manly to do so. There are figures in the background, but they lack sufficient detail.

    - the kidney shaped blotches of color look like jelly beans
    - This painting makes me feel sleepy. The angle of the brush strokes on the diagonal and the brown tones seemingly sliding down the painting to the right put me in mind of drifting off into sleep.

    - It looks like someone splattered the paper with blue paint - light blue and dark blue.
    - It looks like someone just splattered color with a paintbrush.
    - I can feel a reflection of someone's expression to some degree in this painting. It makes me want to find how many figures I can make out from this painting. I feel like I can see a horse head and other animals through the lines.
    - Simple and amazing. It looks like darkness around a door, but there is also goodness.
    - I love how the red and black contrast in big brush strokes
    - the bright colors and the lines lead my eye around the page and is very stimulating to look at
    - The shapes float in an ethereal miasma.

    - Ugly painting of a bunch of colors splayed on a canvas and what looks like a tadpole. Ugly as hell

    - This feels like a well loved piece of fabric or a blanket
    - I hate the lines drawn across this it looks like it is being crossed out.

    - I don't really feel anything, because this just looks like a piece of metal that got corroded really badly.

    - Though perhaps abstract, the work evokes the scene of a wounded flock of birds.
